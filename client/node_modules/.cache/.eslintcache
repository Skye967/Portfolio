As a child from a rural area he had to learn trade skills out of necessity. <span> His vast skill set, experience, and work ethic make him an asset</span> to anyone he works with. After much thought and deliberation about the future, Skye decided to try his hand at coding knowing it was unlike anything that he had done before. He practiced coding every chance he got.  Learning something new everyday made him hunger for more. Finally after months of practice, he was ready to make a career change. He <span>signed up with Coding Dojo</span>, one the most pristigious coding bootcamps in the United States. Consistantly a top performer and always helping out where he could, he made the most of his time there.
